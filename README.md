Requirements Document for User Authentication and Profile Management Web Application using Ruby on Rails
1. Project Overview
This document outlines the requirements for developing a web application for user authentication and profile management using Ruby on Rails. The application will allow users to register, log in, and manage their profile information. Each user will have a unique instance of the frontend to view and edit their profile data.

2. Objectives
Provide a seamless user registration and authentication system.
Enable users to view and edit their profile information.
Ensure secure handling of user data and authentication processes.
3. Stakeholders
Project Manager
Developers
QA Team
End Users
4. Functional Requirements
User Registration

Users should be able to register using their email and a generated password.
Email verification may be required.
User Authentication

Users should be able to log in using their email and password.
Implement session-based authentication.
User Profile Management

Users should be able to view their profile information.
Users should be able to edit their profile details, including name, email, and password.
Frontend Interface

Provide a simple and intuitive user interface for profile management.
Use Rails views and forms for the frontend.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
Security

Encrypt passwords using BCrypt.
Use secure session management.
Implement CSRF protection for forms.
Performance

Ensure the application performs efficiently with a large number of users.
Usability

The user interface should be user-friendly and accessible.
Maintainability

Code should be well-documented and follow Rails conventions.
Ensure the application is easy to maintain and extend.
6. Technical Requirements
Platform

Ruby on Rails 6.x or 7.x
PostgreSQL for the database
Libraries and Gems

Devise for authentication (optional but recommended)
BCrypt for password hashing
Bootstrap for frontend styling (optional)
Hosting and Deployment

Use Heroku or a similar platform for deployment.
7. Detailed Functional Requirements
User Registration

Endpoint: /users/new
Form Fields: Name, Email, Password, Password Confirmation
Actions:
User submits the registration form.
Server validates input and creates a new user.
Password is hashed using BCrypt.
User is redirected to their profile page upon successful registration.
User Authentication

Endpoint: /login
Form Fields: Email, Password
Actions:
User submits the login form.
Server validates credentials.
Session is created for the authenticated user.
User is redirected to their profile page upon successful login.
User Profile Management

View Profile
Endpoint: /users/:id
Display userâ€™s name, email, and other profile details.
Edit Profile
Endpoint: /users/:id/edit
Form Fields: Name, Email, Password (optional), Password Confirmation (optional)
Actions:
User submits the edit form.
Server validates input and updates user information.
User is redirected to their profile page upon successful update.
8. Database Schema
Users Table

id: Integer, Primary Key
name: String, not null
email: String, not null, unique
password_digest: String, not null
created_at: DateTime
updated_at: DateTime
9. User Stories
Registration
As a new user, I want to register with my email and a password so that I can create an account.
